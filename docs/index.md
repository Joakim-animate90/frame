## Frame

A simple frame for quickly setting up api servers based on [go-cloud](https://github.com/google/go-cloud) framework

### Overview

Frame lets you do anything you want to do your way. It organizes and simplifies access to the things 
you utilize within your setup. Only what is initialized at startup is what frame will instantiate at runtime.
Under the hood, frame utilizes [go-cloud](https://github.com/google/go-cloud) to be cloud native without a lot of worries on being locked in.
